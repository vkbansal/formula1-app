Hello! My name is Vivek Kumar Bansal and this is a hobby project of mine. It combines 2 of my favourite things: **Formula 1** and **Web Development**!

The aim of this project is to provide some statistics and data visualisations around Formula 1. Data is taken from <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/" target="_blank">Ergast developer API</a>. The code is open-source and is available on <a href="https://github.com/vkbansal/formula1-app" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
